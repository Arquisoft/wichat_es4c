== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Domain Concepts

The WIChat system is built around the concept of an interactive question-and-answer game where users receive hints to guess the correct answer. The system integrates data from WikiData and utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate dynamic hints.

Key domain concepts include:

Users: Participants interacting with WIChat.

Questions & Answers: Content dynamically generated from WikiData.

Hints: AI-generated assistance to guide users.

Ranking: Scores and leaderboards to enhance engagement.

Game settings: Personalize your games

=== User Experience (UX) Concepts

User experience is a fundamental aspect of WIChat, ensuring seamless interaction and intuitive design.

Minimalist UI Design: A clean and distraction-free interface.

Real-time Feedback: Immediate responses to user input.

Gamification Elements: Leaderboards, game settings and friend system to boost user engagement.

=== Security and Safety Concepts

Security is a critical component of WIChat, ensuring safe interactions and data integrity.

Authentication and Authorization: User authentication through secure protocols and token validation to access protected resources.

Input Validation: Preventing injection attacks and ensuring data integrity.


=== Architecture and Design Patterns

WIChat follows established software design principles to ensure scalability and maintainability.

Services Architecture: Decoupled services to improve scalability, its not pure microservices because the auth service and user service both share the same instance in the database, question service uses other one different though.



=== "Under-the-hood" - Technical Implementation

Backend: Implemented using Node.js with Express.

Frontend: Built with React for a dynamic user experience.

Database: MongoDB as the primary data store.

LLM Integration: Gemini AI used for hint generation.

External Data Source: WikiData for retrieving question-related information.

External Data Source: Gemini AI retrieves hints for the user.

=== Development Concepts

Version Control: Git and GitHub for source code management.

Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD): Automated testing and deployment pipelines.

Code Reviews: Peer reviews to maintain code quality.


=== Operational Concepts

Logging & Monitoring: Centralized logging and performance monitoring tools.

Error Handling: Graceful degradation strategies for unexpected failures.
