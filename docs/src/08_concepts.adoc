== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Domain Concepts

The WIChat system is built around the concept of an interactive question-and-answer game where users receive hints to guess the correct answer. The system integrates data from WikiData and utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate dynamic hints.

Key domain concepts include:

Users: Participants interacting with WIChat.

Questions & Answers: Content dynamically generated from WikiData.

Hints: AI-generated assistance to guide users.

Ranking: Scores and leaderboards to enhance engagement.

=== User Experience (UX) Concepts

User experience is a fundamental aspect of WIChat, ensuring seamless interaction and intuitive design.

Minimalist UI Design: A clean and distraction-free interface.

Real-time Feedback: Immediate responses to user input.

Gamification Elements: Leaderboards and friend system to boost user engagement.

=== Security and Safety Concepts

Security is a critical component of WIChat, ensuring safe interactions and data integrity.

Authentication and Authorization: User authentication through secure protocols and token validation to access protected resources.

Input Validation: Preventing injection attacks and ensuring data integrity.


=== Architecture and Design Patterns

WIChat follows established software design principles to ensure scalability and maintainability.

Microservices Architecture: Decoupled services to improve scalability.



=== "Under-the-hood" - Technical Implementation

Backend: Implemented using Node.js with Express.

Frontend: Built with React for a dynamic user experience.

Database: MongoDB as the primary data store.

LLM Integration: Gemini AI used for hint generation.

External Data Source: WikiData for retrieving question-related information.

=== Development Concepts

Version Control: Git and GitHub for source code management.

Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD): Automated testing and deployment pipelines.

Code Reviews: Peer reviews to maintain code quality.


=== Operational Concepts

Logging & Monitoring: Centralized logging and performance monitoring tools.

Error Handling: Graceful degradation strategies for unexpected failures.
