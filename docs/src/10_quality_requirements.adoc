== Quality Requirements


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****

.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Tree

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.

.Form
Tabular or free form text.

==== Usage Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,3,3,1"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Motivation | Usage Scenario | Priority

| _Usability_
| The application must be intuitive and easy to navigate, especially for new users.
| A new user can register, understand the rules, and start a quiz without external guidance.
| High

| _Interactivity_
| To engage users with real-time feedback during the quiz.
| Upon selecting an answer, the system immediately displays whether the answer is correct and then seamlessly transitions to the next question.
| High

| _Availability_
| The app must be accessible at any time to ensure users can play the quiz whenever desired.
| The system maintains enabled most of the time.
| High

| _Scalability_
| The system should accommodate a growing number of concurrent users without performance degradation.
| The application supports multiple concurrent users .
| Medium

| _Performance_
| To ensure a smooth and responsive quiz experience.
| When a user submits an answer, the system processes the response and updates the UI as quickly as possible.
| Medium

| _Reliability_
| To deliver consistent and accurate quiz results.
| The system accurately records user answers, scores, and game statistics in every quiz session.
| High

| _Testability_
| The design should allow for efficient automated testing.
| Developers can run unit and integration tests to verify quiz logic and API endpoints with minimal configuration.
| Medium

==== Change Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,3,3,1"]
|===
| Change Scenario | Motivation | Expected Response | Priority

| _Adding New Quiz Categories_
| To expand content and keep the quiz engaging.
| New categories can be integrated into the system without impacting existing functionality.
| Medium

| _Enhancing Chat Assistance_
| To improve user support by leveraging upgrades in the Gemini LLM.
| The chat module can be updated or replaced with enhanced capabilities without affecting core quiz functionality.
| Medium

| _Adding a ranking_
| To give the user a more competitive view of the game.
| The dedicated user service can be extended for it to save more information about users to represent it on the ranking.
| Medium

| _Game History_
| Give the user the opportunity to see what went wrong (or good).
| User service is extended for this, making possible to view the last games the user has played.
| Medium

| _Friends System_
| To give the user the possibility of adding users.
| User service is extended for this, a user can add another one as their friend to see how it's doing in the app. This functionality can be easily extended to build multiplayer games where you can play against your friends.
| Medium

| _Adding an admin panel_
| To give the admin a clear view of the users in the system and manage them.
| User and auth services are extended for this, as the admin can delete users (work for user service) and to enter the admin panel the user has to be an admin (authorization is work for the auth service).
| Medium

| _Game Settings_
| To give the user the chance of adjusting parameters to play the game (response time, number of questions, what type of questions does he wants).
| Question service is adapted for this, as it is responsible for the questions and the game component is adapted to handle the new parameters. User service is extended too to save the user settings for the next time he wants to log in again into the app.
