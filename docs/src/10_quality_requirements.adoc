.Content
This section contains all quality requirements as quality tree with scenarios. The most important ones have already been described in section 1.2. (quality goals)

Here you can also capture quality requirements with lesser priority,
which will not create high risks when they are not fully achieved.

.Motivation
Since quality requirements will have a lot of influence on architectural
decisions you should know for every stakeholder what is really important to them,
concrete and measurable.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-10/[Quality Requirements] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Quality Tree

[options="header",cols="1,2,2,1"]
|===
|Quality Category|Quality|Description|Scenario
| _Usability_ | _Easy to use_ | _Ease of use by the user when playing games or moving around the application._ | _SC1_
| __ | _Easy to learn_ | _Game modes should be intuitive._ | __
| _Maintainability_ | _Robustness_ | _The application must be able to respond to user requests first._ | _SC2_
| __ | _Persistence_ | _There will be no partial loss of user information and data._ | __
| _Performance efficiency_ | _Response time_ | _The application should not exceed 3 seconds of waiting time for any job._ | _SC3_
| _Security_ | _Integrity_ | _User data must be kept confidential and secure at all times._ | __

.Content
The quality tree (as defined in ATAM – Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) with quality/evaluation scenarios as leafs.

.Motivation
The tree structure with priorities provides an overview for a sometimes large number of quality requirements.

.Form
The quality tree is a high-level overview of the quality goals and requirements:

* tree-like refinement of the term "quality". Use "quality" or "usefulness" as a root
* a mind map with quality categories as main branches

In any case the tree should include links to the scenarios of the following section.

=== Quality Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,4"]
|===
|Id|Scenario
| _SC1_ | _A new user registers in the application and can start playing without the need to view a user guide._
| _SC2_ | _A user performs an action in the application that results in an internal error, but the user can still use the application normally._
| _SC3_ | _A playing user will be viewing the different questions with little or no waiting time._

.Contents
Concretization of (sometimes vague or implicit) quality requirements using (quality) scenarios.

These scenarios describe what should happen when a stimulus arrives at the system.

For architects, two kinds of scenarios are important:

* Usage scenarios (also called application scenarios or use case scenarios) describe the system’s runtime reaction to a certain stimulus. This also includes scenarios that describe the system’s efficiency or performance. Example: The system reacts to a user’s request within one second.
* Change scenarios describe a modification of the system or of its immediate environment. Example: Additional functionality is implemented or requirements for a quality attribute change.

.Motivation
Scenarios make quality requirements concrete and allow to
more easily measure or decide whether they are fulfilled.

Especially when you want to assess your architecture using methods like
ATAM you need to describe your quality goals (from section 1.2)
more precisely down to a level of scenarios that can be discussed and evaluated.

.Form
Tabular or free form text.

==== Change Scenarios

[options="header",cols="1,3,3,1"]
|===
| Change Scenario | Motivation | Expected Response | Priority

| _Adding New Quiz Categories_
| To expand content and keep the quiz engaging.
| New categories can be integrated into the system without impacting existing functionality.
| Medium

| _Enhancing Chat Assistance_
| To improve user support by leveraging upgrades in the Gemini LLM.
| The chat module can be updated or replaced with enhanced capabilities without affecting core quiz functionality.
| Medium

| _Adding a ranking_
| To give the user a more competitive view of the game.
| The dedicated user service can be extended for it to save more information about users to represent it on the ranking.
| Medium

| _Game History_
| Give the user the opportunity to see what went wrong (or good).
| User service is extended for this, making possible to view the last games the user has played.
| Medium

| _Friends System_
| To give the user the possibility of adding users.
| User service is extended for this, a user can add another one as their friend to see how it's doing in the app. This functionality can be easily extended to build multiplayer games where you can play against your friends.
| Medium

| _Adding an admin panel_
| To give the admin a clear view of the users in the system and manage them.
| User and auth services are extended for this, as the admin can delete users (work for user service) and to enter the admin panel the user has to be an admin (authorization is work for the auth service).
| Medium

| _Game Settings_
| To give the user the chance of adjusting parameters to play the game (response time, number of questions, what type of questions does he wants).
| Question service is adapted for this, as it is responsible for the questions and the game component is adapted to handle the new parameters. User service is extended too to save the user settings for the next time he wants to log in again into the app.
