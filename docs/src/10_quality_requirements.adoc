| Medium

| _Friends System_
| To give the user the possibility of adding users.
| User service is extended for this, a user can add another one as their friend to see how it's doing in the app. This functionality can be easily extended to build multiplayer games where you can play against your friends.

| _Adding an admin panel_
| To give the admin a clear view of the users in the system and manage them.
| User and auth services are extended for this, as the admin can delete users (work for user service) and to enter the admin panel the user has to be an admin (authorization is work for the auth service).

| _Game Settings_
| To give the user the chance of adjusting parameters to play the game (response time, number of questions, what type of questions does he wants).
