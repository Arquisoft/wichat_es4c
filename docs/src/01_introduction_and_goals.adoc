== Introduction and Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. 
These include

* underlying business goals, 
* essential features, 
* essential functional requirements, 
* quality goals for the architecture and
* relevant stakeholders and their expectations

WIChat is an AI-powered web application for **RTVE**, aiming to develop an online quiz inspired by *Saber y Ganar*. This project will introduce a **conversational AI** feature that provides hints to contestants using an LLM.

This document describes the key requirements and quality goals for the project. It also identifies the stakeholders and their expectations.


=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.

The WIChat system must fulfill the following essential requirements:



.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

* **User registration and authentication**: Users must be able to create accounts and log in.
* **Image-based questions**: The game will display an image, and users must identify its location.
* **AI-generated hints**: Players can request hints about the image through a conversational interface powered by an external **LLM**.
* **Automatic content generation**: Images and hints must be dynamically created using **Wikidata**.
* **Game scoring and rewards**: Users earn points or rewards for correct answers.
* **API access**: External systems should be able to retrieve quiz data and user performance information through an API.
* **Time-limited responses**: Each question must be answered within a given timeframe.
* **Leaderboard**: Users can view their ranking and compare their performance with others.

=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]

.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

endif::arc42help[]

[options="header",cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Motivation | Concrete Scenario 

| *Usability* | The game must provide an intuitive and engaging user experience | The UI should be clear and easy to navigate, with a conversational AI that is easy to interact with 

| *Performance* | AI-generated hints should be delivered quickly to avoid disrupting gameplay | Hints generated via the **LLM** should have a response time of **less than 3 seconds**

| *Security* | Protecting user data and preventing AI model abuse is critical | User interactions should be encrypted and respect user privacy and data protection laws.

| *AI Adaptability* | The **LLM** should provide relevant and contextually appropriate hints | The AI must be fine-tuned to ensure accurate and helpful responses based on **Wikidata** sources

| *Scalability* | The system must handle multiple simultaneous users without slowdowns | The game should support multiple concurrent players with minimal latency

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
