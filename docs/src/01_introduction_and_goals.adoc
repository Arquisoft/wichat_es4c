== Introduction and Goals


WIChat is an AI-powered web application for **RTVE**, aiming to develop an online quiz inspired by *Saber y Ganar*. This project will introduce a **conversational AI** feature that provides hints to contestants using an LLM.

This document describes the key requirements and quality goals for the project. It also identifies the stakeholders and their expectations.


=== Requirements Overview


* **User registration and authentication**: Users must be able to create accounts and log in.
* **Image-based questions**: The game will display an image, and users must identify its location.
* **AI-generated hints**: Players can request hints about the image through a conversational interface powered by an external **LLM**.
* **Automatic content generation**: Images and hints must be dynamically created using **Wikidata**.
* **Game scoring and rewards**: Users earn points or rewards for correct answers.
* **API access**: External systems should be able to retrieve quiz data and user performance information through an API.
* **Time-limited responses**: Each question must be answered within a given timeframe.
* **Leaderboard**: Users can view their ranking and compare their performance with others.
