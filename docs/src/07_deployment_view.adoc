== Deployment View


=== Infrastructure

The following overview diagram shows the overall deployment of the Quiz Web Application. It illustrates how the system is distributed within an Azure Virtual Machine using Docker containers, and how the individual services interact with each other as well as with external services.



Motivation::
The infrastructure has been designed to support a distributed system where each microservice is encapsulated in its own Docker container. This approach facilitates scalability, ease of deployment, and fault isolation. The use of an Azure VM provides a robust hosting environment, while external integrations (as with Wikidata) enrich the application's functionality.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
Software components are each deployed in their own Docker container within Azure. The GatewayService orchestrates communication among these services, while persistent data is managed by a MongoDB database. The QuestionService also interacts with the external Wikidata service to retrieve dynamic content for the quiz.

==== _Azure VM and Docker Containers_

Within Azure, the following Docker containers are deployed:

* **WebApp:**  
  Hosts the Quiz Application front-end, which is accessed via a Web Browser by the end user.
  
* **GatewayService:**  
  Acts as the central API gateway, routing user requests from the WebApp to the appropriate back-end services.
  
* **AuthService:**  
  Manages user authentication and connects to the database for credential verification.
  
* **UserService:**  
  Handles user management functions, including registration, profile updates, and statistics.
  
* **LLMService:**  
  Processes natural language queries and interacts with the database to store and retrieve processed data.
  
* **QuestionService:**  
  Generates quiz questions and, in addition to accessing the internal MongoDB, retrieves external data from Wikidata.
  
* **MongoDB (Database):**  
  Provides persistence for user data and other application data like questions.

Communication between these containers is managed internally within Azure, ensuring secure and efficient data transfer.

==== _External Services_

* **Wikidata:**  
  The QuestionService accesses Wikidata to fetch additional data for quiz questions. 

* **Gemini AI:**  
  The LLM Service uses Gemini to give the user the hints requested.
