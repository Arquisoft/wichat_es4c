.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. Technical infrastructure used to execute your system, including geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels, and network topologies, as well as other infrastructure elements.
 2. Mapping of (software) building blocks to these infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments (e.g., development, test, production). In such cases, document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as a distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server, or container, or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective, it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they require.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence a system and/or some cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

.Form
Maybe a highest-level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2 as a technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section, one can zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:
* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view (using nested diagrams if necessary).
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any diagram that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.

.Further Information
See https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/[Deployment View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

The following overview diagram shows the overall deployment of the Quiz Web Application. It illustrates how the system is distributed within an Azure Virtual Machine using Docker containers, and how the individual services interact with each other as well as with external services.



Motivation::
The infrastructure has been designed to support a distributed system where each microservice is encapsulated in its own Docker container. This approach facilitates scalability, ease of deployment, and fault isolation. The use of an Azure VM provides a robust hosting environment, while external integrations (as with Wikidata) enrich the application's functionality.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
Software components are each deployed in their own Docker container within Azure. The GatewayService orchestrates communication among these services, while persistent data is managed by a MongoDB database. The QuestionService also interacts with the external Wikidata service to retrieve dynamic content for the quiz.

=== Infrastructure Level 2

==== _Azure VM and Docker Containers_

Within Azure, the following Docker containers are deployed:

* **WebApp:**  
  Hosts the Quiz Application front-end, which is accessed via a Web Browser by the end user.
  
* **GatewayService:**  
  Acts as the central API gateway, routing user requests from the WebApp to the appropriate back-end services.
  
* **AuthService:**  
  Manages user authentication and connects to the database for credential verification.
  
* **UserService:**  
  Handles user management functions, including registration, profile updates, and statistics.
  
* **LLMService:**  
  Processes natural language queries and interacts with the database to store and retrieve processed data.
  
* **QuestionService:**  
  Generates quiz questions and, in addition to accessing the internal MongoDB, retrieves external data from Wikidata.
  
* **MongoDB (Database):**  
  Provides persistence for user data and other application data.

Communication between these containers is managed internally within Azure, ensuring secure and efficient data transfer.

==== _External Services_

* **Wikidata:**  
  The QuestionService accesses Wikidata to fetch additional data for quiz questions.
